        My goal is to be a full stack web developer. To achieve my goal I
        practice everyday. I complete every module before deadline. After 3 or 5
        month I want to see myself as a junior web developer and work as a
        software development company or intern. That's why I have to do more
        practice because practice makes a man perfect.
